# Lecture materials for Design of Spaceflight Vehicles

Lecture materials for Design of Spaceflight Vehicles in Hokkaido Summer Institute 2023

# Outlines

The main topics of this lecture are the entry, descent, and landing (EDL) process in space transportation for spacecraft that return to the Earth from space. From the viewpoints of high-enthalpy flow dynamics, we will learn the extreme environment that appears near the spacecraft during the EDL such as aerodynamic heating, aerodynamic instability, and communication blackout. In addition, we will learn the applications to spacecraft design and development through the understanding of the EDL. The high-enthalpy wind tunnels, such as supersonic wind tunnels and plasma wind tunnels, which reproduce the EDL environment on the ground, will be introduced. Computational science approaches will also be introduced Including performing orbital dynamics calculations and computational fluid dynamics as the lecture content. Through these contents, we aim to understand the EDL process and to acquire the basics of spacecraft design.


# Course Objectives

This lecture will focus on the design of spaceflight vehicles. Space transportation from space to the ground involves atmospheric entry, descent, and landing (EDL) processes. The characteristics of these EDL processes will be explained, as well as the phenomena that occur and their effects and problems on the vehicle. This knowledge will be necessary for the design of spaceflight vehicles in EDL processes. The fundamentals of compressible fluid dynamics, high enthalpy flow dynamics, and orbital mechanics will be provided. In addition, their applications to spaceflight vehicle design will be studied. The roles of the computational science approach and high enthalpy wind tunnels will also be explained. Recent projects and activities in space missions will be introduced.
